## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add `CommonModelTpl` to share computations between Costs, Dynamics and Constraints ([#133](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/pull/133))

## [0.6.1] - 2024-05-27

### Added

- Add force and wrench cone costs
- Add centroidal momentum cost

### Changed

- Do not compile or use `gar::ParallelRiccatiSolver<>` when OpenMP support is disabled ([#160](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/pull/160))

## [0.6.0] - 2024-05-23

### Added
- Added constrained LQR example ([#145](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/pull/145))
- Adds [tracy](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/tracy) as a profiling tool
- Adds a new sublibrary called `gar` to represent and solve time-varying linear-quadratic subproblems
- Adds a parallel, block-sparse factorization for the implicit/proximal Riccati algorithm
- Integrates the CHOLMOD solver from the SuiteSparse library into `gar`
- Add a C++ example and benchmark of Talos walking by @edantec
- Add a `BlkMatrix<>` template class for dealing with block Eigen matrices effectively
- Copy the headers from [boost::core::span](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/libs/core/doc/html/core/span.html)
- Add SE2 car benchmark `bench/se2-car.cpp`
- Split part of `macros.hpp` into new header `eigen-macros.hpp`, add `ALIGATOR_NOMALLOC_SCOPED` macro to disable Eigen's malloc per-scope and a caching system to restore the malloc status
- Add `context.hpp` file for `aligator/modelling/dynamics`

### Changed

- Standardized CMake output directories ([#147](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/pull/147))
- Split derivative computation into first- and second-order functions per stage by @fabinsch
- Changed minimum version of C++ to C++17 (no longer use `boost::optional` or `boost::filesystem`)
- SolverProxDDP now uses linear solvers provided by `gar` (API breaking), add `LQSolverChoice` enum
- Minimum version of eigenpy upgraded to 3.4 (for supporting `std::unique_ptr`)
- Move cost functions to `aligator/modelling/costs`
- Deprecate `ControlBoxFunction`
- Remove `LDLTChoice` enum (API breaking)
- Refactor computation of problem Lagrangian's gradient
- Remove `aligator/core/stage-data.hxx`
- StageModel/StageData now store dynamics model/data separate from other constraints, add `dynamics_data` to `StageData`
- Rewrite the `Logger` class (rename from `BaseLogger`) using map data structures to store line formatting info + content
- Merge struct ODEData into ContinousDynamicsData, rename continous-base.hpp header to continuous-dynamics-abstract
- Optimize a few includes for faster compilation:
  - `aligator/modelling/dynamics/fwd.hpp`
  - `aligator/core/stage-model.hpp` no longer includes `aligator/core/cost-abstract.hpp`
  - Split `traj-opt-data.hpp` out of `traj-opt-problem.hpp`

#### Python API

- Rename `ContinousDynamicsBase` to `ContinousDynamicsAbstract`
- Rename `CostBase` to `CostAbstract`
- Expose `TrajOptData.init_data`
- Remove `LDLTChoice` enum and `SolverProxDDP.ldlt_solver_choice` attribute
